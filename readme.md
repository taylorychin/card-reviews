# Deck Review List
This is a website designed to allow people to view and leave reviews on various decks of cards. It Allows for people to sign in via their google 
account and restricts people who are not that user from editing or deleting their posts or reviews.

# Getting Started
[Open app](https://deck-review-list.herokuapp.com/)

When first logging in to the website users are able to view all the entries and reviews for the website. But are not able to create entries or 
leave reviews unless they are logged in though googles Oauth.
Once logged in a user is able to create a new deck. Which includes The name, designing company, printing company, a description, and a link to a picture.
After creating a deck the user is able to edit the deck, that user and any other user are able to leave reviews/comments on the deck. Users are able to 
delete their own comments but not others comments.

# Next Steps
Given more time I would like to further refine the CSS styling to make the website look better. I would also like to add administator rights 
so that a single admin user can moderate and remove comments duplicate posts, or profane reviews.
